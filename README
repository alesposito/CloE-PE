CloE-PE is developped in Matlab and provides a tool to simulate Clonal Evolotion. 
PE stays for Polyclonal Edition as we have developped a number of such MOnte Carlo simulations.
CloE-PE simulates a tissue of N cells in the presence of proliferation, cell death and mutations. 
When mutations occur, they might introduce a fitness advantage. 
CloE-PE was designed to simulate the role of those mutations that cause a fitness advantage through cell-to-cell communication, i.e. non-cell-autonomous mechanisms
