CloE-PE is a repository of code from Alessandro Esposito (University of Cambridge) for simulate Clonal Evolution during the early steps of oncogenesis. 

The first release is to permit anyone to reproduce the results linked in the bioRxiv paper which is, at the time of writing in peer-review. You might find additional code that is in support of the final peer-reviewed edition.

We also link the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and a Mathematica notebook describing a discrete-time Markov Chain model.

PE refers to Polyclonal Edition as we have developped a number of such Monte Carlo simulations. CloE-PE simulates a tissue of N cells in the presence of proliferation, cell death and mutations. When mutations occur, they might introduce a fitness advantage. CloE-PE was designed to simulate the role of those mutations that cause a fitness advantage through cell-to-cell communication, i.e. non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.
